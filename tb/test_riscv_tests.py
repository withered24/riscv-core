"""The official RISC-V compliance tests (riscv-tests, rv32ui-p-*) on the core.

Each test is a self-checking program: it runs its checks, then stores to a
magic address called `tohost`. A value of 1 means pass; (n << 1) | 1 means
check number n failed. On top of that self-check, every instruction is run
in lockstep against the golden model, so a failure points at the exact
instruction rather than just "test case 7".

Build the tests first (the pytest entry point below does it for you):
    python tests/build_rvtests.py
Run:
    pytest tb/test_riscv_tests.py -v
When one fails, open tests/build/<name>.dump to read the disassembly.
